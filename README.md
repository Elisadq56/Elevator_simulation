# Elevator_simulation

You need to use Jupyter Notebook to use this code.

Code written in June and July 2020 by Camille Forns and Jonathan Perun during their internship of second year of engineering school at the ENTPE supervised by ChB (Licit, ENTPE/ Université Gustave Eiffel). The code was first improved by ChB. Then it was arranged by Thibault Charlottin and Anthony Grasser in 2021. ChB polished it a second time. Then in 2022 Flore Barré and Elisa Diot-Quéré traduced it in English and published it in Gitbub.

The following version is simplified and meant for a basic use. There is a unique simulation of a unique hotel containing one single elevator. All users are alone in their room and stay for one single night.

Use this simulation to test the impact of encouraging the use of the stairs instead of the elevator on the energy consumption of the elevator.
